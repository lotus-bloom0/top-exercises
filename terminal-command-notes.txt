pwd
    prints the user’s current working directory.

ls [path]
    prints a listing of a specific file or directory;
    ls on its own lists the current working directory.

cd [path]
    changes the current working directory.

/
    on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.

.
    on its own means ‘the current directory’; .. means ‘the directory above the current one’.

cp [old] [new]
    copies a file.

mkdir [path]
    creates a new directory.

mv [old] [new]
    moves (renames) a file or directory.

rm [path]
    removes (deletes) a file.

*
    matches zero or more characters in a filename, so *.txt matches all files ending in .txt.

?
    matches any single character in a filename, so ?.txt matches a.txt but not any.txt.

wc
    counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs.

cat
    displays the contents of its inputs.

sort
    sorts its inputs.

head
    displays the first 10 lines of its input.

tail
    displays the last 10 lines of its input.

command > [file]
    redirects a command’s output to a file (overwriting any existing content).

command >> [file]
    appends a command’s output to a file.

[first] | [second]
    is a pipeline: the output of the first command is used as the input to the second.
    The best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters).

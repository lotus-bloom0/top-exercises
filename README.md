# The Odin Project Exercises
This is a GitHub repository for my journey through The Odin Project.

I already have some experience in HTML and CSS, so my pages for the early assignments are a little goofy. Gotta break up the monotony sometimes.

Below is an index for where to locate each assignment and project. The header hyperlinks open to the lesson's location on The Odin Project's website.

## [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)
Introduction, Prerequisites, and Git Basics did not have assignments that required the creation of documents.

### [HTML Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations)
The following lesson's assignments are combined into one document, "index.html"
- Introduction to HTML and CSS
- Elements and Tags
- HTML Boilerplate
- Working with Text
- Lists
- Links and Images
- Commit Messages

Lesson "Project: Recipes" is located at my [odin-recipes repository](https://github.com/lotus-bloom0/odin-recipes).
